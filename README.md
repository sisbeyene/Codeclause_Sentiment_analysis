Sentiment Analysis Project - CodeClause

Introduction:
This repository contains the code and resources for my project on Sentiment Analysis using Jupyter Notebook, which I completed during my internship with CodeClause. The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model that predicts the sentiment of text data as either positive or negative. The dataset used for training the model was obtained from Kaggle.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Results{
The sentiment analysis model achieved an accuracy of more than 78% in predicting whether the sentiment of the text is positive or negative. While this accuracy is reasonably good, further model tuning and experimentation may be done to improve the performance.
